# multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app
This repository contains the codebase for the "Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App". The project aims to provide a user-friendly web interface for predicting multiple diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

# Project Description
The "Multiple Disease Prediction Streamlit App" utilizes machine learning models trained on relevant datasets to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson's disease based on their input features. The app provides an interactive interface where users can input their health-related parameters and receive predictions for each disease.

# Setup Instructions
To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Celestin25/Multiple_disease_prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory:

cd multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app

# Install the required dependencies for the Streamlit app by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:

streamlit run app.py


# Access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL displayed in the terminal where the Streamlit app is running.

Note
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system and that you are using a compatible version. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for managing dependencies to avoid conflicts with existing packages on your system.
